# RoundUps

## How To Use
You will need to get your Starling Developer I'd to be able to connect to the Starling Bank APIs. This is in a read only state.

Optionally you can also provide an IFTTT Webhooks I'd which can be the trigger for an IFTTT applet. 

Put this PHP script on a server, add the config id's, decide if you want to have JSON or RSS output (none be if your just going to make the Webhooks call).

Then setup a cronjob on your serve our somewhere else to trigger the PHP script.,
